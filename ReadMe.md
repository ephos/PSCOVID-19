## PSCOVID-19

This was a project born out of wanting to just write some code as more cases of COVID-19 started popping up throughout the United States.

This uses the same CSV data files in the Johns Hopkins CSSE [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).  This is a side project I just wanted to write to tinker with data, <span style="color:blue">__**I am in NO WAY affiliated with any health organization or Johns Hopkins**__</span>!
